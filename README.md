# üçî LLM-Enhanced Topic Modeling of Google Reviews

## üìå Project Overview

As a frequent user of Google Maps, I have always relied on **Google Reviews** as my first virtual step before deciding whether to visit a shop. This project explores how **LLMs (Large Language Models) and BERTopic** can be used to analyze customer feedback for **Inglewood**, a well-known burger restaurant in Geneva. As a student, the **Inglewood near Uni Mail** was my go-to spot, and the **Pasadena** burger was my regular order, making it a natural choice for this case study.

I started this project in **2023**, before ChatGPT transformed the field of natural language processing. Initially, I applied more traditional NLP techniques but had to pause due to the birth of my daughter. When I returned to the project, the landscape had changed significantly. **LLM-powered topic modeling** had become the new standard, making my original methods seem primitive. This project is not only an effort to extract **business insights from customer reviews**, but also a reflection on the rapid advancements in AI and the evolving role of LLMs in text analysis.

This project is an independent case study and was not commissioned or sponsored by Inglewood. The data analyzed was publicly available from Google Reviews.

## üß† Results from Topic Modeling

### üîù 1. Top Topics & Distributions
Used BERTopic with LLM-generated topic labels to group reviews into key themes like **Burger Quality**, **Fries Quality**, **Ambiance**, and **Service**. The most frequent topic was related to **burger quality**, confirming its central importance in customer feedback.

The largest topic,**Burger Quality**,clearly stands out from the rest, showing its dominance in the review data.

This chart highlights the top keywords associated with each identified topic. These terms, like ‚Äúburger‚Äù for Burger Quality or ‚Äúservice‚Äù for Customer Service Quality, give quick insight into what each cluster of reviews is really about.

The dendrogram shows how customer concerns naturally group together, topics like service speed, ambiance, and menu variety often go hand in hand. It reveals what matters most to people when they visit this place.
![Hierarchical Clustering](/assets/images/hierarchical_clustering.png)

This is a similarity matrix generated by BERTopic, which shows how closely related each pair of topics is based on their embeddings. In future iterations, I could consider merging highly similar topics or refining category definitions to reduce overlap and improve clarity in the clustering results.

### ‚ùó 2. Deep Dive into Negative Reviews
I filtered the reviews labeled with **negative sentiment** and explored their associated topics. I grouped them into the top 10 customer concerns, each paired with a suggestion for improvement. One recurring theme was the long wait times, which, to be honest, didn‚Äôt surprise me. From personal experience (as far as I can recall), Inglewood doesn‚Äôt take reservations, which might explain the delays. But then again, a wait is almost expected at popular spots. Try getting a table at a Michelin-starred place in France without booking months ahead!

### üçî 3. Product-Specific Comments
To better understand product-specific feedback, I pulled Inglewood‚Äôs burger menu and performed named entity recognition on the reviews to match comments to each mentioned burger. Then, I ran a focused review analysis on the mentioned items. Unsurprisingly, Cain Cain, Inglewood‚Äôs signature burger, came out on top with glowing reviews. It was frequently described as the best in town, often paired with praise for the fries. Close behind were the Buffalo and Valaisan burgers, both loved for their rich flavors and unique ingredients. I might just have to try those next time I stop by Inglewood.
